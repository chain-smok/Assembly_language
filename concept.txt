SWI:software interrupt
pc=000000004 =>address=4
addressing:retrieve data from memory location
LDR:let us load data from stack into register
!:pre-increment
stack memory is stored in ram of computer
we can store more data in ram than in register
SP(stack pointer) tell us next available memory in stack
memory in emulator is in unit of 4
lr(link register) stores the locaction that a function should return back
pc(program counter) keeps track of the location of the next instruction to execute
our instruction store in memory
CPSR register can store info about our program,it can set flag
SUBS is going to set the flags in CPSR register
N which is bolded in CPSR register means it identified the result was a negative number
the eight in first four bits of CPSR represents 1 of the flags
if we want to add a carry operation,we need to use ADC operation,it will add a query to
a result.
ORR:or,eor:exclusive or
branch allow us to move our program to different locations based on the result of comparisons.
